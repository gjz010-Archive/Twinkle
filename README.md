Project Twinkle:An implement of Minecraft Server.

This project aims to provide a light-weighted server that can be deployed onto PaaS platforms(e.g. Openshift).The server should be scalable(both scale and sub-server)and support P2P transmission(e.g. P2P chunk downloading),even cloud computing using player's client(e.g. Singleplayer world),to make the server faster and more flexible than Vanilla servers(and variaties like Bukkit).Meanwhile,no changes are needed to apply to the Minecraft client(except mods,as mods will be mods).All players need to do is to use a local client to connect to the server(e.g. TwinkleCE).
