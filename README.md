Project Twinkle:An implement of Minecraft Server.

This project aims to provide a light-weighted server that can be deployed onto PaaS platforms(e.g. Openshift).The server should be scalable(both scale and sub-server)and support P2P transmission(e.g. P2P chunk downloading),even cloud computing using player's client(e.g. Singleplayer world),to make the server fast than Vanilla servers(and variaties like Bukkit).
